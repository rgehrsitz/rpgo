# FERS Calculator Refactoring Status

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE (October 2025)

This document summarizes the completed refactoring that made the FERS retirement calculator fully generic to support flexible household compositions with any participant names, eliminating all hardcoded "Robert/Dawn" references.

## Completed Phase 1: Foundational Code and Data Refactoring âœ…

### âœ… New Domain Structures

- **`domain.Participant`**: Generic participant struct supporting both federal and non-federal employees
- **`domain.Household`**: Container for participants with filing status
- **`domain.ParticipantScenario`**: Flexible scenario definition per participant  
- **`domain.GenericScenario`**: Household-level scenario with multiple participants

### âœ… Backwards Compatibility

- Legacy `robert`/`dawn` configuration format still fully supported
- Automatic format detection and conversion
- Seamless transition path for existing users
- All existing configuration files continue to work unchanged

### âœ… Configuration Schema Updates

- New participant-based YAML format with `household` and `generic_scenarios` sections
- Support for mixed households (federal + non-federal employees)
- Support for single federal employee scenarios
- Enhanced validation for participant-specific rules (FEHB holders, federal employee requirements)

### âœ… Calculation Engine Updates  

- `RunScenarioAuto()`: Automatic format detection and routing
- `RunGenericScenario()`: New method for participant-based calculations
- Legacy conversion bridge for calculation compatibility
- Maintained all existing calculation accuracy and logic

### âœ… Testing and Validation

- Comprehensive unit tests for format detection and conversion
- Table-driven tests covering multiple household configurations:
  - Single federal employee
  - Dual federal employees  
  - Mixed households (one federal, one private sector)
- Golden test validation ensuring existing Robert/Dawn scenarios produce identical results
- Round-trip conversion testing (Employee â†” Participant)

## âœ… Phase 2 Completed: Full Output Generification

### All Limitations Resolved

The refactoring is now **100% complete**. All hardcoded "Robert" and "Dawn" references have been eliminated from the calculation engine and output formatting.

### 1. âœ… Refactored AnnualCashFlow Structure

The `domain.AnnualCashFlow` struct now uses dynamic participant maps:

```go
type AnnualCashFlow struct {
    Year      int
    Date      time.Time
    Ages                        map[string]int             // participantName -> age
    Salaries                    map[string]decimal.Decimal // participantName -> salary
    Pensions                    map[string]decimal.Decimal // participantName -> pension
    SurvivorPensions            map[string]decimal.Decimal // participantName -> survivor pension
    TSPWithdrawals              map[string]decimal.Decimal // participantName -> tsp_withdrawal
    SSBenefits                  map[string]decimal.Decimal // participantName -> social security
    FERSSupplements             map[string]decimal.Decimal // participantName -> fers supplement
    TSPBalances                 map[string]decimal.Decimal // participantName -> tsp balance
    ParticipantTSPContributions map[string]decimal.Decimal // participantName -> tsp contributions
    IsDeceased                  map[string]bool            // participantName -> deceased status
    // ... household-level totals and taxes
}
```

### 2. âœ… Updated Projection Generation

The projection generation in `internal/calculation/projection.go`:

- âœ… Iterates over participants dynamically instead of hardcoded robert/dawn
- âœ… Uses actual participant names as keys in the map-based structure
- âœ… Maintains calculation accuracy while supporting flexible participants
- âœ… No hardcoded references to specific participant names

### 3. âœ… Refactored Output Formatters

All output formatters now support dynamic participants:

- âœ… **Console Formatter**: Uses participant names from configuration
- âœ… **Console Verbose Formatter**: Dynamically displays each participant's income sources
- âœ… **JSON Formatter**: Exports participant-keyed maps
- âœ… **CSV Formatter**: Supports variable numbers of participants
- âœ… **HTML Formatter**: Renders participant-agnostic templates

Example output with custom names (Alice Johnson & Bob Smith):

```text
INCOME SOURCES:
  Alice Johnson's Salary:        $188,165.59
  Bob Smith's Salary:            $116,617.59
  Alice Johnson's FERS Pension:  $1,000.76
  Bob Smith's FERS Pension:      $18,692.53
  Alice Johnson's TSP Withdrawal: $273.80
  Bob Smith's TSP Withdrawal:     $5,240.86
```

### 4. âœ… Validated with Multiple Configurations

The system has been tested and validated with:

- âœ… Original Robert/Dawn configuration (backwards compatibility)
- âœ… Generic configuration with full names (Robert F. Gehrsitz, Dawn M. Gehrsitz)
- âœ… Completely different names (Alice Johnson, Bob Smith)
- âœ… All tests pass with 100% accuracy maintained

### Code Quality: Variable Naming Improvements

All confusing variable names that suggested hardcoded logic have been refactored to use generic naming:

**Tax Calculation Functions** - Now use clear, generic parameter names:

- `CalculateTotalTaxes(..., ageParticipant1, ageParticipant2 int)` - Previously used `ageRobert, ageDawn`
- `calculateFederalTaxWithInflation(..., ageParticipant1, ageParticipant2 int)` - Previously used `ageRobert, ageDawn`
- `CalculateCurrentTaxableIncome(salaryParticipant1, salaryParticipant2)` - Previously used `robertSalary, dawnSalary`

**Engine Functions** - Internal variables renamed for clarity:

- `calculateCurrentNetIncomeGeneric()` now uses `ageParticipant1/2` and `salaryParticipant1/2`
- Clear comments explain that these represent the first and second household participants
- No more misleading variable names that suggest hardcoded logic

### Legacy Code Note

One legacy function remains for backwards compatibility with old integration tests:

- `NetIncomeCalculator.Calculate(robert, dawn *domain.Employee)` - **CLEARLY MARKED AS LEGACY** with documentation
  - Parameter names remain `robert` and `dawn` for API compatibility
  - Internal variables renamed to `ageParticipant1/2`, `participant1FICA/participant2FICA`, etc.
  - Function is clearly documented as legacy-only with comments directing new code to use the generic functions
  - Only used by legacy integration tests, not in production calculation paths

This legacy function does not affect the generic calculation path and is clearly marked to prevent future confusion.

## Supported Scenarios âœ…

The current implementation successfully supports:

1. **Single Federal Employee**
   - Complete FERS calculations (pension, TSP, FEHB, FERS supplement)
   - Proper tax treatment and benefit timing
   - Works with both new and legacy configuration formats

2. **Dual Federal Employees**
   - Full household calculations with both participants
   - Coordinated retirement timing and benefit optimization
   - FEHB primary/secondary holder logic
   - Survivor benefit elections

3. **Mixed Households** (One Federal, One Private)  
   - Federal employee gets full FERS calculations
   - Non-federal employee gets Social Security and external pension support
   - Proper tax treatment and filing status handling
   - External pension COLA adjustments and survivor benefits

## Migration Guide

### For New Configurations

Use the new participant-based format:

```yaml
household:
  filing_status: "married_filing_jointly" 
  participants:
    - name: "Employee Name"
      is_federal: true
      # ... participant details
```

### For Existing Configurations  

No changes required - legacy format continues to work:

```yaml
personal_details:
  robert:
    # ... existing format
  dawn:
    # ... existing format
```

## Testing Coverage

- âœ… Format detection and validation
- âœ… Configuration parsing for both formats
- âœ… Participant conversion (Employee â†” Participant)  
- âœ… Legacy configuration backwards compatibility
- âœ… Multiple household scenario calculations
- âœ… Edge cases (single participant, invalid configurations)
- âœ… Golden test validation against known results

## Performance Impact

The refactoring maintains performance characteristics:

- Legacy format: No performance impact (direct processing)
- New format: Minimal overhead from format conversion bridge
- Memory usage: Slightly increased due to format flexibility, but negligible for practical scenarios
- Calculation accuracy: Identical results to original implementation

## Conclusion

**Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 are now 100% complete!** ðŸŽ‰

The retirement calculator is now **fully generic** and supports:

- âœ… Flexible household compositions (single, dual, mixed federal/non-federal)
- âœ… Any participant names (not limited to "Robert" and "Dawn")
- âœ… Dynamic output formatting that uses actual participant names
- âœ… Full backwards compatibility with legacy configurations
- âœ… All calculation accuracy maintained

Users can immediately begin using the new participant-based configuration format with any participant names to model various household compositions. The output will automatically display the correct participant names throughout all reports and visualizations.

### Example Configurations Supported

1. **Legacy format** (robert/dawn) - Still fully supported for backwards compatibility
2. **Generic format with full names** - Robert F. Gehrsitz, Dawn M. Gehrsitz
3. **Any custom names** - Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, or any other names
4. **Single participant** - One federal employee
5. **Mixed households** - Federal employee + private sector spouse

All scenarios produce accurate calculations with properly labeled output using the actual participant names from the configuration file.
