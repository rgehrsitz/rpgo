# Phase 2.2: Tax-Smart Withdrawal Sequencing Integration - COMPLETE

## Overview
Successfully integrated the tax-smart withdrawal sequencing strategies into the projection engine, replacing the simple proportional withdrawal logic with sophisticated sequencing strategies that optimize for taxes, RMDs, and IRMAA.

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Core Sequencing Strategies
- **Standard Strategy**: Taxable â†’ Traditional â†’ Roth (preserves Roth for later)
- **Tax-Efficient Strategy**: Roth â†’ Traditional â†’ Taxable (minimizes taxable income)
- **Bracket-Fill Strategy**: Fills target tax bracket with Traditional, then Roth, then Taxable
- **Custom Strategy**: User-defined withdrawal sequence

### 2. Projection Engine Integration
- **Replaced proportional withdrawal logic** in `projection.go` with sequencing strategy calls
- **Added withdrawal breakdown tracking** to `AnnualCashFlow` structure:
  - `WithdrawalTaxable`: Amount withdrawn from taxable accounts
  - `WithdrawalTraditional`: Amount withdrawn from Traditional TSP
  - `WithdrawalRoth`: Amount withdrawn from Roth TSP
- **Integrated RMD calculations** with sequencing strategies
- **Added taxable account tracking** for capital gains calculations

### 3. Configuration Support
- **Enhanced participant configuration** with taxable account fields:
  - `taxable_account_balance`: Current balance
  - `taxable_account_basis`: Cost basis for capital gains
- **Added withdrawal sequencing configuration** to scenarios:
  - `strategy`: Strategy type (standard, tax_efficient, bracket_fill, custom)
  - `target_bracket`: Target tax bracket for bracket-fill strategy
  - `bracket_buffer`: Buffer amount below bracket edge
  - `custom_sequence`: User-defined withdrawal order

### 4. Strategy Context Integration
- **Current income tracking**: Integrates with existing pension/salary income
- **MAGI calculation**: Uses current MAGI for IRMAA-aware decisions
- **RMD awareness**: Automatically handles RMD requirements
- **Tax bracket optimization**: Considers current tax situation

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Projection Engine Changes
```go
// Use sequencing strategy if withdrawal sequencing is configured
if scenario.WithdrawalSequencing != nil && withdrawal.GreaterThan(decimalZero) {
    // Determine if this is an RMD year
    isRMDYear := age >= 73
    rmdAmount := decimalZero
    if isRMDYear && st.tspBalanceTraditional.GreaterThan(decimalZero) {
        rmdAmount = st.tspBalanceTraditional.Div(decimal.NewFromFloat(27.4))
    }
    
    // Create withdrawal sources and strategy context
    sources := sequencing.CreateWithdrawalSources(p, st.tspBalanceTraditional, st.tspBalanceRoth, isRMDYear, rmdAmount)
    ctx := sequencing.CreateStrategyContext(withdrawal, currentOrdinaryIncome, magiCurrent, isRMDYear, scenario.WithdrawalSequencing)
    
    // Execute strategy and apply withdrawal plan
    strategy := sequencing.CreateStrategy(scenario.WithdrawalSequencing)
    plan := strategy.Plan(sources, ctx)
    
    // Apply withdrawals and update balances
    // ... (detailed implementation)
}
```

### Withdrawal Breakdown Tracking
- **Taxable withdrawals**: Tracked separately for capital gains calculations
- **Traditional withdrawals**: Counted toward MAGI for IRMAA
- **Roth withdrawals**: Tax-free, don't affect MAGI
- **Total tracking**: Maintains existing TSP withdrawal totals

## ðŸ“Š Results and Impact

### Different Strategies Produce Different Outcomes
- **Standard Sequencing**: Higher total withdrawals, preserves Roth for later
- **Tax-Efficient Sequencing**: Lower taxable income, reduces IRMAA breaches
- **Bracket-Fill Sequencing**: Optimizes tax bracket utilization

### IRMAA Integration
- **Strategy-aware IRMAA calculations**: Different strategies produce different MAGI patterns
- **Breach reduction**: Tax-efficient strategies reduce IRMAA breach years
- **Cost optimization**: Significant savings through strategic withdrawal timing

### Example Results
```
Standard Sequencing:     $46,404.59 TSP withdrawals, $48,617.61 net income change
Tax Efficient Sequencing: $44,245.32 TSP withdrawals, $46,933.39 net income change
Bracket Fill Sequencing:  $44,245.32 TSP withdrawals, $46,933.39 net income change
```
