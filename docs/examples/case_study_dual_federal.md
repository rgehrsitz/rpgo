## Retirement Scenarios Analyzed

### Scenario 1: Early Retirement 2026
**Strategy**: Both retire together to maximize time together

- **John Retires**: June 1, 2026 (age 61, 39 years of service)
- **Jane Retires**: August 15, 2026 (age 58, 34 years of service)
- **Social Security**: Both claim at age 62 (reduced benefits)
- **TSP Strategy**: 4% withdrawal rule for both

**Key Benefits**:
- Immediate FERS pension for both (eligible due to age + service)
- FERS Special Retirement Supplement until Social Security eligibility
- Full FEHB continuation in retirement

### Scenario 2: Optimized Retirement 2028
**Strategy**: Delayed retirement for higher benefits

- **John Retires**: March 15, 2028 (age 63, 41 years of service)
- **Jane Retires**: August 15, 2029 (age 61, 37 years of service)
- **Social Security**: Both wait for Full Retirement Age (67)
- **TSP Strategy**: Need-based withdrawals ($4,000 and $3,500/month respectively)

**Key Benefits**:
- Higher FERS pension due to additional years of service
- Full Social Security benefits (no early retirement reduction)
- More conservative TSP withdrawal approach

## Key Planning Considerations

### FERS Pension Calculation
Both employees benefit from the standard FERS formula:
- **Basic Formula**: Years of Service × 1.0% × High-3 Salary
- **Enhanced Formula**: Available at age 62+ with 20+ years (1.1% multiplier)

### TSP Asset Allocation
The couple uses different risk profiles based on their ages:

**John (Age 60)**: More conservative approaching retirement
- 45% C Fund, 15% S Fund, 15% I Fund, 20% F Fund, 5% G Fund

**Jane (Age 57)**: Slightly more aggressive with more time
- 35% C Fund, 10% S Fund, 10% I Fund, 35% F Fund, 10% G Fund

### Social Security Optimization
The timing of Social Security claims significantly impacts lifetime benefits:
- **Early at 62**: Permanent 30% reduction in benefits
- **Full Retirement Age (67)**: 100% of calculated benefit
- **Delayed to 70**: 132% of FRA benefit (24% increase)

### Tax Considerations
- **Pennsylvania Residency**: Retirement income (pension, TSP, SS) is tax-exempt
- **Federal Taxes**: Apply to TSP withdrawals and pension income
- **IRMAA**: High earners may face Medicare premium surcharges

## Results Summary

The analysis shows both scenarios provide comfortable retirement income that exceeds their pre-retirement net income when accounting for:
- Elimination of TSP contributions (15% and 12% of salary)
- Elimination of FICA taxes
- Addition of FERS pension income
- Strategic TSP withdrawals
- Pennsylvania's favorable tax treatment of retirement income

This demonstrates the strength of the FERS system for federal employees who maximize their benefits through:
1. **Long federal careers** (30+ years of service)
2. **Consistent TSP contributions** (10-15% with full government match)
3. **Strategic retirement timing** (optimizing pension multipliers)
4. **Coordinated spousal planning** (FEHB coverage, Social Security timing)

## Configuration Files

The complete configuration files for this case study can be found in:
- `example_generic_config.yaml` - Using the new participant-based format
- `golden_config.yaml` - Using the legacy robert/dawn format

Both configurations produce identical results, demonstrating the backwards compatibility of the new system.
